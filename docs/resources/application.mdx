## Installation Context

:::info
The user installation context for apps is currently in a public preview and is subject to change. Read details and limitations about the public preview in the [change log](/change-log#user-installable-apps-preview).
:::

An app's installation context defines how it's installed: to a server, to a user, or both.

The installation context affects how your app can be seen and used within Discord. For example, apps installed only to a user can't take actions in a server, and apps installed only to a server can't be accessed within a user's DMs.


#### Server Context

Apps installed in a server context (server-installed apps) must be authorized by a server member with the [`MANAGE_GUILD`](/topics/permissions#bitwise-permission-flags) permission. Server-installed apps are *visible* to all members of the server, but other factors (like [command permissions](/interactions/application-commands#permissions)) determine where and when specific members can interact with the app.

During installation, server-installed apps are authorized with a specific set of [OAuth2 scopes](/topics/oauth2#oauth2-scopes) and [bot user permissions](/topics/permissions) that determine what resources and data the app can access in that server.

#### User Context

Apps installed in a user context (user-installed apps) are visible *only* to the authorizing user, and therefore don't require any server-specific permissions.

Apps that support the user installation context are visible across all of an authorizing user's servers, DMs, and GDMs, but are forced to respect the user's permissions in the surface where the app is being used. For example, if a user invokes a command for a user-installed app from a server's channel where they don't have permission to send messages, the app won't be able to [respond to an interaction](/interactions/receiving-and-responding#interaction-callback-type) with a non-ephemeral message. Details about how the installation context of a command affects interactions is in the [interaction context](/interactions/application-commands#interaction-contexts) documentation.

### Setting Supported Installation Contexts

By default, newly-created apps only support installation to guilds.

You can update which installation contexts your app supports in your [app's settings](https://discord.com/developers/applications). On the **Installation** page under the **Authorization Methods** section, you can select the installation contexts your app supports.

:::info
If you update your app to support a new installation context, you will need to update your existing [commands](/interactions/application-commands#contexts) if you want them to be supported in the new context. Details are in the [Application Command](/interactions/application-commands#contexts) documentation.
