\* If updating `entity_type` to `EXTERNAL`:

- `channel_id` is required and [must be set to null](/resources/guild-scheduled-event#field-requirements-by-entity-type)
- `entity_metadata` with a `location` field must be provided
- `scheduled_end_time` must be provided

## Delete Guild Scheduled Event

<RoutePill method="DELETE">/guilds/[\{guild.id\}](/resources/guild#guild-object)/scheduled-events/[\{guild_scheduled_event.id\}](/resources/guild-scheduled-event#guild-scheduled-event-object)</RoutePill>

Delete a guild scheduled event. Returns a `204` on success. Fires a [Guild Scheduled Event Delete](/topics/gateway-events#guild-scheduled-event-delete) Gateway event.

## Get Guild Scheduled Event Users

<RoutePill method="GET">/guilds/[\{guild.id\}](/resources/guild#guild-object)/scheduled-events/[\{guild_scheduled_event.id\}](/resources/guild-scheduled-event#guild-scheduled-event-object)/users</RoutePill>

Get a list of guild scheduled event users subscribed to a guild scheduled event. Returns a list of [guild scheduled event user](/resources/guild-scheduled-event#guild-scheduled-event-user-object) objects on success. Guild member data, if it exists, is included if the `with_member` query parameter is set.

###### Query String Params

| Field        | Type      | Description                                   | Default |
|--------------|-----------|-----------------------------------------------|---------|
| limit?       | number    | number of users to return (up to maximum 100) | 100     |
| with_member? | boolean   | include guild member data if it exists        | false   |
| before? *    | snowflake | consider only users before given user id      | null    |
| after? *     | snowflake | consider only users after given user id       | null    |

\* Provide a user id to `before` and `after` for pagination. Users will always be returned in ascending order by `user_id`. If both `before` and `after` are provided, only `before` is respected. Fetching users in-between `before` and `after` is not supported.


## Guild Scheduled Event Status Update Automation

NOTE: `status` and `entity_type` here are expressed by name rather than their value for readability

### An active scheduled event for a stage channel where all users have left the stage channel will automatically end a few minutes after the last user leaves the channel

When an event with `'status': ACTIVE` and `'entity_type': STAGE_INSTANCE` has no users connected to the stage channel for a certain period of time (on the order of minutes), the event `status` will be automatically set to `COMPLETED`.

### An active scheduled event for a voice channel where all users have left the voice channel will automatically end a few minutes after the last user leaves the channel

When an event with `'status': ACTIVE` and `'entity_type': VOICE` has no users connected to the voice channel for a certain period of time (on the order of minutes), the event `status` will be automatically set to `COMPLETED`.

### An external event will automatically begin at its scheduled start time

An event with `'entity_type': EXTERNAL` at its `scheduled_start_time` will automatically have `status` set to `ACTIVE`.

### An external event will automatically end at its scheduled end time

An event with `'entity_type': EXTERNAL` at its `scheduled_end_time`  will automatically have `status` set to `COMPLETED`.

### Any scheduled event which has not begun after its scheduled start time will be automatically cancelled after a few hours

Any event with `'status': SCHEDULED` after a certain time interval (on the order of hours) beyond its `scheduled_start_time` will have its `status` automatically set to `CANCELLED`.
