An **[Interaction](/interactions/receiving-and-responding#interaction-object)** is the message that your application receives when a user uses an application command or a message component.

For [Slash Commands](/interactions/application-commands#slash-commands), it includes the values that the user submitted.

For [User Commands](/interactions/application-commands#user-commands) and [Message Commands](/interactions/application-commands#message-commands), it includes the resolved user or message on which the action was taken.

For [Message Components](/interactions/message-components) it includes identifying information about the component that was used. It will also include some metadata about how the interaction was triggered: the `guild_id`, `channel`, `member` and other fields. You can find all the values in our data models below.

\* This is always present on application command, message component, and modal submit interaction types. It is optional for future-proofing against new interaction types

\*\* `member` is sent when the interaction is invoked in a guild, and `user` is sent when invoked in a DM

\*\*\* `app_permissions` includes `ATTACH_FILES | EMBED_LINKS | MENTION_EVERYONE` permissions for (G)DMs with other users, and additionally includes `USE_EXTERNAL_EMOJIS` for DMs with the app's bot user

\*\*\*\* This is available on all interaction types except PING

###### Interaction Type

| Name                             | Value |
|----------------------------------|-------|
| PING                             | 1     |
| APPLICATION_COMMAND              | 2     |
| MESSAGE_COMPONENT                | 3     |
| APPLICATION_COMMAND_AUTOCOMPLETE | 4     |
| MODAL_SUBMIT                     | 5     |

###### Interaction Context Types

Context in Discord where an interaction can be used, or where it was triggered from. Details about using interaction contexts for application commands is in the [commands context documentation](/interactions/application-commands#interaction-contexts).

| Name            | Type | Description                                                                    |
|-----------------|------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| GUILD           | 0    | Interaction can be used within servers                                         |
| BOT_DM          | 1    | Interaction can be used within DMs with the app's bot user                     |
| PRIVATE_CHANNEL | 2    | Interaction can be used within Group DMs and DMs other than the app's bot user |

###### Authorizing Integration Owners Object

The `authorizing_integration_owners` field includes details about the authorizing user or server for the installation(s) relevant to the interaction. For apps installed to a user, it can be used to tell the difference between the authorizing user and the user that triggered an interaction (like a message component).

A key will only be present if the following are true:

- The app has been authorized to the [installation context](/resources/application#application-integration-types) corresponding to the key (`GUILD_INSTALL` or `USER_INSTALL`)
- The interaction is supported in the source [interaction context](/interactions/receiving-and-responding#interaction-context-types) (`GUILD`, `BOT_DM`, or `PRIVATE_CHANNEL`) for the installation context corresponding to the key
- And for command invocations, the command must be supported in the installation context (using [`integration_types`](/interactions/application-commands#contexts))

The values in `authorizing_integration_owners` depend on the key—

- If the key is `GUILD_INSTALL` (`"0"`), the value depends on the source of the interaction:
    - The value will be the guild ID if the interaction is triggered from a server
    - The value will be `"0"` if the interaction is triggered from a DM with the app's bot user
- If the key is `USER_INSTALL` (`"1"`), the value will be the ID of the authorizing user

###### Interaction Data

While the `data` field is guaranteed to be present for all [interaction types](/interactions/receiving-and-responding#interaction-type) besides `PING`, its structure will vary. The following tables detail the inner `data` payload for each interaction type.

###### Application Command Data Structure

:::info
Sent in `APPLICATION_COMMAND` and `APPLICATION_COMMAND_AUTOCOMPLETE` interactions.

###### Application Command Interaction Data Option Structure

All options have names, and an option can either be a parameter and input value--in which case `value` will be set--or it can denote a subcommand or group--in which case it will contain a top-level key and another array of `options`.

`value` and `options` are mutually exclusive.

This means responses to [Message Components](/interactions/message-components) do not include this property, instead including a [message reference](/resources/channel#message-reference-structure) object as components _always_ exist on preexisting messages.

## Receiving an Interaction

When a user interacts with your app, your app will receive an **[Interaction](/interactions/receiving-and-responding#interaction-object)**. Your app can receive an interaction in one of two ways:

-   Via [Interaction Create](/topics/gateway-events#interaction-create) gateway event
-   Via outgoing webhook

These two methods are **mutually exclusive**; you can _only_ receive Interactions one of the two ways. The `INTERACTION_CREATE` [Gateway Event](/topics/gateway-events#interaction-create) may be handled by connected clients, while the webhook method detailed below does not require a connected client.

If you want to receive interactions via HTTP-based outgoing webhooks, you must configure an Interactions Endpoint URL for your app. You can read about preparing and adding an Interactions Endpoint URL to your app in the [Preparing for Interactions](/interactions/overview#preparing-for-interactions) section in Interactions Overview.

### Interaction Metadata

An [Interaction](/interactions/receiving-and-responding#interaction-object) includes metadata to aid your application in handling it as well as `data` specific to the interaction type. You can find samples for each interaction type on their respective pages:

- [Slash Commands](/interactions/application-commands#example-slash-command-interaction)
- [User Commands](/interactions/application-commands#example-user-command-interaction)
- [Message Commands](/interactions/application-commands#example-message-command-interaction)
- [Message Components](/interactions/message-components#sample-component-interaction)
- [Select Menu Message Components](/interactions/message-components#select-menu-interaction)

An explanation of all the fields can be found in our [data models](/interactions/receiving-and-responding#interaction-object).

Now that you've gotten the data from the user, it's time to respond to them.

## Responding to an Interaction

Interactions--both receiving and responding--are webhooks under the hood. So responding to an Interaction is just like sending a webhook request!

There are a number of ways you can respond to an interaction:

:::warning
While interaction responses and followups are webhooks, they respect @everyone's ability to ping @everyone / @here . Nonetheless if your application responds with user data, you should still use [`allowed_mentions`](/resources/channel#allowed-mentions-object) to filter which mentions in the content actually ping. Other differences include the ability to send named links in the message content (`[text](url)`).
:::

When responding to an interaction received **via webhook**, your server can simply respond to the received `POST` request. You'll want to respond with a `200` status code (if everything went well), as well as specifying a `type` and `data`, which is an [Interaction Response](/interactions/receiving-and-responding#interaction-response-object) object:

```py
@app.route('/', methods=['POST'])
def my_command():
    if request.json["type"] == 1:
        return jsonify({
            "type": 1
        })

    else:
        return jsonify({
            "type": 4,
            "data": {
                "tts": False,
                "content": "Congrats on sending your command!",
                "embeds": [],
                "allowed_mentions": { "parse": [] }
            }
        })
```

If you are receiving Interactions over the gateway, you will **also need to respond via HTTP**. Responses to Interactions **are not sent as commands over the gateway**.

To respond to a gateway Interaction, make a `POST` request like this. `interaction_id` is the unique id of that individual Interaction from the received payload. `interaction_token` is the unique token for that interaction from the received payload. **This endpoint is only valid for Interactions received over the gateway. Otherwise, respond to the `POST` request to issue an initial response.**

```py
import requests

url = "https://discord.com/api/v10/interactions/<interaction_id>/<interaction_token>/callback"

json = {
    "type": 4,
    "data": {
        "content": "Congrats on sending your command!"
    }
}
r = requests.post(url, json=json)
```

:::info
Interaction `tokens` are valid for **15 minutes** and can be used to send followup messages but you **must send an initial response within 3 seconds of receiving the event**. If the 3 second deadline is exceeded, the token will be invalidated.
:::

## Followup Messages

Sometimes, your bot will want to send followup messages to a user after responding to an interaction. Or, you may want to edit your original response. Whether you receive Interactions over the gateway or by outgoing webhook, you can use the following endpoints to edit your initial response or send followup messages:

- [`PATCH /webhooks/<application_id>/<interaction_token>/messages/@original`](/interactions/receiving-and-responding#edit-original-interaction-response) to edit your initial response to an Interaction
- [`DELETE /webhooks/<application_id>/<interaction_token>/messages/@original`](/interactions/receiving-and-responding#delete-original-interaction-response) to delete your initial response to an Interaction
- [`POST /webhooks/<application_id>/<interaction_token>`](/interactions/receiving-and-responding#create-followup-message) to send a new followup message
- [`PATCH /webhooks/<application_id>/<interaction_token>/messages/<message_id>`](/interactions/receiving-and-responding#edit-followup-message) to edit a message sent with that `token`

:::info
Interactions webhooks share the same rate limit properties as normal webhooks.
:::

Interaction tokens are valid for **15 minutes**, meaning you can respond to an interaction within that amount of time.

### Endpoints

:::info
The endpoints below are not bound to the application's [Global Rate Limit](/topics/rate-limits#global-rate-limit).
:::

## Create Interaction Response

<RoutePill method="POST">/interactions/[\{interaction.id\}](/interactions/receiving-and-responding#interaction-object)/[\{interaction.token\}](/interactions/receiving-and-responding#interaction-object)/callback</RoutePill>

Create a response to an Interaction from the gateway. Body is an [interaction response](/interactions/receiving-and-responding#interaction-response-object). Returns `204 No Content`.

This endpoint also supports file attachments similar to the webhook endpoints. Refer to [Uploading Files](/reference#uploading-files) for details on uploading files and `multipart/form-data` requests.

## Get Original Interaction Response

<RoutePill method="GET">/webhooks/[\{application.id\}](/resources/application#application-object)/[\{interaction.token\}](/interactions/receiving-and-responding#interaction-object)/messages/@original</RoutePill>

Returns the initial Interaction response. Functions the same as [Get Webhook Message](/resources/webhook#get-webhook-message).

## Edit Original Interaction Response

<RoutePill method="PATCH">/webhooks/[\{application.id\}](/resources/application#application-object)/[\{interaction.token\}](/interactions/receiving-and-responding#interaction-object)/messages/@original</RoutePill>

Edits the initial Interaction response. Functions the same as [Edit Webhook Message](/resources/webhook#edit-webhook-message).

## Delete Original Interaction Response

<RoutePill method="DELETE">/webhooks/[\{application.id\}](/resources/application#application-object)/[\{interaction.token\}](/interactions/receiving-and-responding#interaction-object)/messages/@original</RoutePill>

Deletes the initial Interaction response. Returns `204 No Content` on success.

## Create Followup Message

<RoutePill method="POST">/webhooks/[\{application.id\}](/resources/application#application-object)/[\{interaction.token\}](/interactions/receiving-and-responding#interaction-object)</RoutePill>

Create a followup message for an Interaction. Functions the same as [Execute Webhook](/resources/webhook#execute-webhook), but `wait` is always true. The `thread_id`, `avatar_url`, and `username` parameters are not supported when using this endpoint for interaction followups.

`flags` can be set to `64` to mark the message as ephemeral, except when it is the first followup message to a deferred Interactions Response. In that case, the `flags` field will be ignored, and the ephemerality of the message will be determined by the `flags` value in your original ACK.

## Get Followup Message

<RoutePill method="GET">/webhooks/[\{application.id\}](/resources/application#application-object)/[\{interaction.token\}](/interactions/receiving-and-responding#interaction-object)/messages/[\{message.id\}](/resources/channel#message-object)</RoutePill>

Returns a followup message for an Interaction. Functions the same as [Get Webhook Message](/resources/webhook#get-webhook-message).

## Edit Followup Message

<RoutePill method="PATCH">/webhooks/[\{application.id\}](/resources/application#application-object)/[\{interaction.token\}](/interactions/receiving-and-responding#interaction-object)/messages/[\{message.id\}](/resources/channel#message-object)</RoutePill>

Edits a followup message for an Interaction. Functions the same as [Edit Webhook Message](/resources/webhook#edit-webhook-message).

## Delete Followup Message

<RoutePill method="DELETE">/webhooks/[\{application.id\}](/resources/application#application-object)/[\{interaction.token\}](/interactions/receiving-and-responding#interaction-object)/messages/[\{message.id\}](/resources/channel#message-object)</RoutePill>

Deletes a followup message for an Interaction. Returns `204 No Content` on success.
