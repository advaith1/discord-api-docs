###### SKU Types

For subscriptions, SKUs will have a type of either `SUBSCRIPTION` represented by `type: 5` or `SUBSCRIPTION_GROUP` represented by `type:6`. For any current implementations, you will want to use the SKU defined by `type: 5`. A `SUBSCRIPTION_GROUP` is automatically created for each `SUBSCRIPTION` SKU and are not used at this time.

| Type               | Value | Description                                              |
|--------------------|-------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| DURABLE            | 2     | Durable one-time purchase                                |
| CONSUMABLE         | 3     | Consumable one-time purchase                             |
| SUBSCRIPTION       | 5     | Represents a recurring subscription                      |
| SUBSCRIPTION_GROUP | 6     | System-generated group for each SUBSCRIPTION SKU created |

###### SKU Flags

For subscriptions, there are two types of access levels you can offer to users:

-   **Guild Subscriptions**: A subscription purchased by a user and applied to a single server. Everyone in that server gets your premium benefits.
-   **User Subscriptions**: A subscription purchased by a user for themselves. They get access to your premium benefits in every server.

The `flags` field can be used to differentiate user and server subscriptions with a bitwise `&&` operator.

| Type               | Value    | Description                                                                                                               |
|--------------------|----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| AVAILABLE          | `1 << 2` | SKU is available for purchase                                                                                             |
| GUILD_SUBSCRIPTION | `1 << 7` | Recurring SKU that can be purchased by a user and applied to a single server. Grants access to every user in that server. |
| USER_SUBSCRIPTION  | `1 << 8` | Recurring SKU purchased by a user for themselves. Grants access to the purchasing user in every server.                   |

## Customizing Your SKUs

Within your app's settings, you're able to customize details about your premium offering:

-   A name for your premium SKU, max 80 characters.
-   A description for your premium SKU, max 160 characters
-   An icon for your premium SKU

![Example SKU customization](/images/sku-customization.png)

### Adding Benefits to Your SKU

You're able to customize a list of up to 6 benefits to explain your premium offering to users. Benefits are displayed on the App Directory and during the purchase and cancellation flows, and each can have:

-   A name, max 80 characters
-   A description, max 160 characters
-   An emoji, standard or custom

![Example of SKU benefits](/images/sku-benefits.png)

#### Using a Unicode Emoji
To set an icon using a standard Unicode emoji, enter the emoji in the `Unicode Emoji or Custom Emoji Name` field.

:::info
Using an emoji keyboard can make it easier to pick an icon to display alongside your SKU benefit.  
::> MacOS: `control + command + space bar`   
> Windows: `Windows + .`

#### Using a Custom Emoji
To use a custom emoji, set a value for both fields:

- Name of your custom emoji
- ID of the custom emoji

:::info
You can find the ID of the emoji in the Discord app by escaping the emoji in a message with a backslash character `\`. For example, `\:uwu:` will render with the name and ID of the emoji.

## Publishing Your SKUs

When you're ready to launch, you can go to your [app's settings](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and change your SKU to "Published", and your premium offering will be live and available for purchase by users.

From then on, we'll send you daily dashboard emails containing information about purchases, cancellations, and other premium information.

Congratulations on going live! ðŸ¥³

## List SKUs

<RoutePill method="GET">/applications/[\{application.id\}](/resources/application#application-object)/skus</RoutePill>

Returns all SKUs for a given application. 

:::info
Because of how our SKU and subscription systems work, you will see two SKUs for your subscription offering. For integration and testing entitlements for Subscriptions, you should use the SKU with `type: 5`.
