# One-Time Purchases

One-time purchases enable you to charge your users for premium functionality with in-app items. Before you can add one-time purchases to your app, you must complete the [Monetization Eligibility Checklist](/monetization/overview#eligibility-checklist) in your [app's settings](https://discord.com/developers/applications).

Once you've confirmed eligibility for your app and team, you will be able to set up a [SKU](/monetization/skus) (stock-keeping unit) to represent your app's premium offering via subscriptions or items.

## Types of One-Time Purchases

When creating items for one-time purchase, you can choose between durable and consumable items:

- **Durable Items**: A one-time purchase that is permanent and is not subject to either renewal or consumption, such as lifetime access to an app's premium features.
- **Consumable Items**: A one-time, non-renewable purchase that provides access, such as a temporary power-up or boost in a game.

You can offer as many one-time purchase SKUs as needed by your app.

## Configuring One-Time Purchases

Once you have an idea what type of items you want to offer for your app, you can create either durable or consumable SKUs to reflect the benefits that the user will receive from purchasing your new item.

As you are setting up a new SKU, you can configure:

- SKU Image
- Name
- Product Description
- Price

## Publishing Your One-Time Purchases

Once you have configured your SKU, you can publish the SKU to either just the API or the API and your Store. Learn more about [Managing Your Store](/monetization/managing-your-store) to curate what items you make available to your users.

## Implementing One-Time Purchases

When a user subscribes to your app, there are a few things you will need to implement in your code to check for subscription status and access.

- Working with Entitlements
- Handling Gateway Events for Entitlements
- Handling Entitlements for Consumable SKUs

### Keeping Track of Entitlements

When a user purchases a one-time purchase SKU, an entitlement is created. [Entitlements](/monetization/entitlements) represent the user's access to your consumable or durable item. You can keep track of entitlements using  Gateway Events and the HTTP API.

#### Entitlement Gateway Events

When users subscribe or renew a subscription with your app, Discord will emit [entitlement gateway events](/monetization/entitlements#gateway-events).

Upon a user's purchase of a SKU, you'll receive an [`ENTITLEMENT_CREATE`](/monetization/entitlements#new-entitlement) event.

#### Entitlement HTTP Endpoints

For apps requiring background processing, keeping track of entitlements is essential. You can utilize the [List Entitlements](/monetization/entitlements#list-entitlements) endpoint to list entitlements. Your app can filter entitlements by a specific user or set of SKUs by using the `?user_id=XYZ` or `?sku_ids=XYZ` query params.

#### Handling Consumable One-Time Purchases

When offering consumable items, users can only have one unconsumed entitlement at a time. In order to handle consumable items in your app or game, you should process and store the consumable item in your app and then make a call to the [Consume Entitlement](/monetization/entitlements#consume-an-entitlement) endpoint so that the user can purchase more of this item in the future.

Consuming the entitlement will update the entitlement to return a true value in the entitlement's `consumed` field. You will need to think through how your app uses consumable items to decide on the best strategy for when to consume these entitlements.

## Testing Your Implementation

:::warning
The method of testing purchases for One-Time Purchases differs from the method for App Subscriptions. **Do NOT use Test Entitlements for One-Time Purchases.**
:::

### Using Application Test Mode

While in Application Test Mode, you can freely make "purchases" of One-Time Purchase SKUs tied to your application. That means you can test buying your consumable and durable items by going through the IAP flow without any credit card charges.

:::info
You still need to have a valid payment method on file to "purchase" SKUs in Application Test Mode. It just won't be charged at checkout.
:::

To enable it, first make sure you have a payment method on file in User Settings -> Billing and then:

1. Open up the Discord app
2. Click on the Settings cog in the bottom left corner
3. Go to the `Advanced` page under App Settings
4. Toggle "Developer Mode" **on** and "Application Test Mode" **on**, and enter your application ID. You can leave the other settings as-is.
5. Exit user settings

Once you enabled Application Test Mode successfully, you should now see an orange bar across the top of your screen with the name of your app.

You can now navigate to your [Store](/monetization/managing-your-store) page and purchase your one-time purchase items without being charged.

The entitlements tied to items that are purchased in Application Test Mode can be identified by entitlements with a `type` value of 4 to represent `TEST_MODE_PURCHASE`.

:::info
The "Go To SKU" button does not currently work. There will be an update there soon. To purchase your SKU in test mode, go to your Store page.

## Receiving Payouts

Once an app has made its first $100 it will become eligible for payout. A review will be conducted and if everything looks good, your team will begin to receive payouts.
